Void Browser

Minimal Python browser for learning and experimenting. Main use: develop the browser and run a private offline TiddlyWiki.

Getting Started with TiddlyWiki: https://tiddlywiki.com/

Quick Features:

Tabbed browsing, back/forward, close tabs

Tracker blocker (Google Analytics, DoubleClick, etc.)

Persistent cookies & cache (keeps login sessions)

Frameless dark UI with custom toolbar & window buttons

URL bar navigation & downloads

Start page = your local TiddlyWiki

Tip: After downloading your TiddlyWiki index.html, point the browser to it by editing in void.py:

startpage_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "void-hub" / "index.html"

Adjust the path to match your folder structure.

Next steps: finer privacy controls, smoother TiddlyWiki saving, tab management, and more personalization.

Open & hackable: Download, tweak, and make it yours.
